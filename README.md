# Pick My Meal - Solving Couples' Greatest Challenge

*"What do you want for dinner, Honey?"*  
*"I don't know, Dear. What do you want?"*

**Can't decide on what to have for dinner? Me too!**

That is why I created Pick My Meal. To help couples land on a meal decision literally at the click of a button.

Then, the next time you see a feud brewing out of meal indecision, you just click the **Random Meal Button**.

Crisis averted.

### Technology used

I had so much fun building Pick My Meal using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery handling all of the UI. The back end was built using Node with Express, Mocha with Chai for testing, and MongoDB with Mongoose for the database layer.
